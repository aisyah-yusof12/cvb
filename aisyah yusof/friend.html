<p>Friends is a someone that closer with us either at the education institution or at the work place.
Friends bring more happiness into our lives than virtually anything else. 
Friendships have a huge impact on your mental health and happiness. Good friends relieve stress, provide comfort and joy, and prevent loneliness and isolation. 
Developing close friendships can also have a powerful impact on your physical health.</p>

<p>I have a lot of friends either in virtual and non virtual. My friends consists from primary school,
secondary school and at the university. Having a good friends is important to ensure the person can 
hear and give the opinion about certain problems that me had. The relationship with my friends become more closer
especially when some of us making a birthday celebration.     </p>
