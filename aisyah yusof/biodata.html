<p> Hello, my name is 'Aisyah Binti Md Yusof. I'm 21 Years Old. I was born on 18 December 2000 at Hospital Kulim Kedah.
I have a big family. There are 9 members in my family included my parents and my loving siblings.
my mother's name is Normalawati Binti Abdul Rahman and my father's name is Md Yusof bin Ahmad.This couple have 7 children, which are 3 girls and 4 boys.
I'm a second child of 7 siblings.</p>

<p> Next my favourite food is chicken rice and my favourite food is apple juice.
Every day I will drink the apple juice or orange juice to keep healthy. My favourite color is blue. I choose blue color becuse the blue is cool, calm, and grounded. 
It symbolizes cold air and water and lays on the opposite end of the spectrum from red which represents heat and energy.  </p>
<p> Other than that, I' m also sister to my sibling. Every day my routine is to take care of my youngest brother while my parents busy at work. It is a huge responsibility for myself to bear responsibility as a sister when my parents are at the outside or busy. 
Therefore, I also a caring and loving sister in taking the responsibility.</p>
